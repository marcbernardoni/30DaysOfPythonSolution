# 1 - Get user input using input(“Enter your age: ”).
#     If user is 18 or older, give feedback: You are old enough to drive.
#     If below 18 give feedback to wait for the missing amount of years.

# 2 - Compare the values of my_age and your_age using if … else.
#     Who is older (me or you)? Use input(“Enter your age: ”) to get the age as input.
#     You can use a nested condition to print 'year' for 1 year difference in age,
#     'years' for bigger differences, and a custom text if my_age = your_age.

# 3 - Get two numbers from the user using input prompt.
#     If a is greater than b return a is greater than b,
#     if a is less b return a is smaller than b, else a is equal to b.
